# General Test: ALMA Synthetic Continuum Observations Clustering Pipeline

Data Augmented to apply random rotations (0째, 90째, 180째, or 270째) during training to improve the model's robustness.

Built and trained an autoencoder to learn a compact latent representation of the images.

Used these latent representations to perform clustering with KMeans. Evaluates clusters using silhouette scores and WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares) to determine the optimal number of clusters.

## Results
Optimal number of clusters based on silhouette score: 2 <br>
At k = 2, Silhouette Score = 0.6253

| k | Silhouette Score
|---|:--------------:|
| 2 |     0.6253     |
| 3 |     0.5844     |
| 4 |     0.5853     |
| 5 |     0.5807     |
| 6 |     0.5620     |
| 7 |     0.5344     |
| 8 |     0.5250     |
| 9 |     0.5017     |

## Physical Properties via Visual Inspection

| Property | Cluster 0 | Cluster 1 | Physical Significance |
|----------|-----------|-----------|------------------------|
| Ring Structure | Multiple rings/gaps | Predominantly single rings | Indicates different stages of planet formation or multiple forming planets |
| Disk Geometry | More elliptical appearance | More circular appearance | Suggests different viewing angles (inclination) or intrinsic structural differences |
| Brightness Distribution | More varied, often asymmetric | More uniform and symmetric | May indicate dust distribution patterns and gravitational perturbations |
| Gap Definition | Sharper transitions between rings | Smoother transitions | Related to planet mass, disk viscosity, and dust migration mechanisms |
| Central Cavity | Variable size and definition | More consistent size | Possibly correlated with stellar wind strength or inner planet clearing |

## Detailed Analysis of Properties and Their Astrophysical Implications

### 1. Ring and Gap Structures

Protoplanetary disks develop rings and gaps primarily through interactions with forming planets. The observed differences between clusters have significant implications:

- **Multiple Ring Systems (Cluster 0)**: 
  - Suggests the presence of multiple planets at different orbital radii
  - Each planet creates a distinct gap by clearing material along its orbit
  - The width and depth of gaps correlate with planet mass
  - More complex systems may indicate a more advanced evolutionary stage or a more massive initial disk

- **Single Ring Systems (Cluster 1)**:
  - May represent earlier stages of planet formation
  - Could indicate the presence of a single dominant forming planet
  - Alternatively, might represent systems where conditions support fewer planet formation sites
  - The smoother transitions suggest less massive planets or different disk viscosity

### 2. Disk Geometry and Inclination

The apparent shape of protoplanetary disks provides information about both viewing geometry and physical properties:

- **Elliptical Appearance (Cluster 0)**:
  - Primary cause is likely viewing angle (inclination relative to line of sight)
  - Higher inclination makes circular disks appear elliptical
  - Can complicate interpretation of gap width and brightness patterns
  - May indicate selection bias in the clustering algorithm

- **Circular Appearance (Cluster 1)**:
  - Suggests more face-on viewing angles
  - Provides clearer view of radial structures
  - Enables more accurate measurements of gap positions and widths
  - Facilitates better estimation of planet orbital distances

### 3. Brightness Distribution and Asymmetry

Brightness variations across the disk reflect the distribution of dust that scatters or emits radiation:

- **Asymmetric Brightness (Cluster 0)**:
  - May indicate the presence of dust traps or vortices
  - Could be caused by gravitational perturbations from companions or nearby stars
  - Associated with local pressure maxima where dust accumulates
  - Often sites of accelerated planet formation

- **Uniform Brightness (Cluster 1)**:
  - Suggests more quiescent disks with less perturbation
  - More axisymmetric gas and dust distribution
  - May indicate different dust grain properties or size distributions
  - Could represent younger, less evolved systems

### 4. Gap Definition and Transition Sharpness

The sharpness of transitions between bright rings and dark gaps provides insights into disk physics:

- **Sharp Transitions (Cluster 0)**:
  - Indicates more massive planets creating well-defined pressure gradients
  - Associated with lower disk viscosity that maintains sharper features
  - May signify more efficient dust filtration mechanisms at gap edges
  - Could indicate stronger gas-dust coupling

- **Smooth Transitions (Cluster 1)**:
  - Suggests lower-mass planets or proto-planets
  - May indicate higher disk viscosity that diffuses sharp features
  - Could represent earlier stages of gap opening
  - Possibly associated with different grain size distributions

### 5. Central Cavity Characteristics

The central region of protoplanetary disks can reveal processes close to the star:

- **Variable Central Features (Cluster 0)**:
  - Differences in inner disk clearing mechanisms
  - May indicate varying strengths of stellar winds or magnetic fields
  - Could suggest the presence of close-in massive planets
  - Diversity might reflect different stellar masses or ages

- **Consistent Central Cavities (Cluster 1)**:
  - More uniform inner disk evolution
  - Possibly similar stellar properties across the sample
  - More consistent inner rim physics
  - May represent a more homogeneous population of young stellar objects

## Implications for Planet Formation

The distinction between these clusters has important implications for understanding planet formation processes:

1. **Formation Pathways**: The two clusters may represent different evolutionary pathways or timescales for planet formation.

2. **Planetary System Architecture**: Cluster 0 disks may be more likely to form systems with multiple planets at various distances, while Cluster 1 might favor simpler planetary configurations.

3. **Disk Environment**: The differences could reflect variations in the initial conditions of the protoplanetary disks, such as mass, composition, or the properties of the host star.

4. **Age Sequence**: The clusters might represent different temporal stages in disk evolution, with one cluster potentially being systematically older than the other.

5. **Planet-Disk Interaction**: The variations in gap structure provide evidence for how forming planets interact with their natal disks, potentially revealing information about planet mass and migration mechanisms.

The clean separation in the t-SNE visualization suggests that despite these potential observational factors, the clustering has identified physically meaningful distinctions between different populations of protoplanetary disks.
