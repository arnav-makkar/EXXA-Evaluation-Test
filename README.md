## About Me
I am a Computer Science Engineering sophomore at one of India's top technical institutions, passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technology to solve real-world challenges. My experience spans industry and research, with focused emphasis on machine learning (ML), quantum machine learning (QML), and blockchain projects.

I am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at the **Center for Artificial Intelligence, IIIT Delhi** on a project on Electronic System Design Manufacturing(ESDM). The project has been funded by the **Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India**, and aims to enhance the government's *Make in India* initiative by integrating AI-driven automation and intelligent decision-making into the manufacturing workflow. I am working under the guidance of **Dr. Jainendra Shukla** and my work involves LLMs for domain-specific applications and designing a blockchain-based patent mechanism, leveraging Hyperledger Fabric and smart contracts for decentralized intellectual property management.

In March 2025, I won the **First Prize** at the annual QML Hackathon organized by the Center for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC), Government of India, competing against **1500+ participants**. I developed a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning model to analyze time series brain signal data. Utilized Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs) and Variational Quantum Circuits to enhance feature extraction. Implemented classical XGBoost for comparative analysis, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Previously, I've worked as a Research Intern under **Dr. Anubha Gupta**, focusing on Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). My work involved annotating, cleaning, and preprocessing over 10,000 short videos for training deep learning models. Explored feature extraction techniques, including spectrograms and traditional MFCCs, while benchmarking pre-trained model embeddings. Contributed to research on co-attention-based fusion and multitask learning, acknowledged in a **published paper**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08931

My ability to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies and to give my best at every project I undertake is my strongest asset. I eagerly look forward to contributing to a GSoC project this summer!
